                <p>So. You want to know more about me?</p>

                <p>My name is Aubrey Vest. I am currently a junior at Chester County High School, but I will be graduating in May with this year's senior class. I have been taking coding courses since my freshman year, and I have been preparing myself for a future of tech. </p>

                <p>I have always been a tech person. I've always been so invested in computers and how they work. I wanted to start coding since a lot of people do, and it seemed easy to me. Boy, was I wrong. Even after three years, I am still not the "coding master" I had dreamed to be, but I have made significant progress. I do not plan on having a career in computer science, though coding will always have a special place in my heart.
